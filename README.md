# Connect Four

This is my first project done with React Js. I created it using the vite development tool and selecting the vanilla option, in order to manually create the entry point and understand the inner workings of React Js.

This is the typical game of connect 4, you can play two people on the same computer and save the data in local storage so that they are not lost when reloading the page. You can see the final result in the images shown below.
